# VF-Project
Project for VF Interview

To use, change the database connection info in config.php.

Then create the table ‘demo’ and add 10 columns: name, email, phone, address 1, address 2, zip, city, state, image, time.

Also, the '$link' variable in 'submit.php' needs changed to whatever server url you're using. 

// Second Upload

Everything on the list from the document has been completed including the stretch goal as it was done last upload. I worked a little bit on this tonight to get it done and uploaded to git for you guys to review. Not the best by any means but like you said, I didn't want to spend too much time on it besides focusing on the working parts. If you have any questions, let me know!

// First Upload

I couldn’t figure out why once the image was submitted it was giving me an index error. I didn’t have too much time to look into it so I let it be and just wrote in the images for each sql entry. 
Things I wasn’t able to complete in two hours:

•	Specifying extension for file upload.

•	Exporting submitted data to a CSV. (not attempted)

•	Sending the two emails after form is submitted. (not attempted)

•	Saving phone number in format of (555) 555-5555

•	Dropdown to sort submitted data on results page. (not attempted)

•	Placeholder image for users who didn’t upload anything. (not attempted)


I did add the API integration so the Zip code fills in the State and City automatically so the “Stretch Goal” was completed. Also, I didn’t style the results page or get to work on a format I’d deem worthy for it.
The biggest problem to me was rushing my work and checking the clock. 

I really wanted to get it done in under two hours but I didn’t complete that. Disappointing as it was for all of the backend issues, I took on the frontend first and turned the PSD into live code as accurate as possible given the time without cleaning it up or adding any extra touches to it.

The only frontend problem: the code is mobile friendly as in it works but that’s just it. I didn’t do any media querying for the font sizes and/or sectional margins so it looks quite wonky.
Overall, worrying about the backend and time constraints is what lead to my demise for this project. I definitely over analyzed the documentation too but all said and done, I’d say I accomplished the goal of the project and I think it’ll give you a better representation where I’m at backend-wise more so than frontend. Given more time, I know I could complete this with higher quality. 

Anyways, it was a pleasure meeting with you both; thanks again!
